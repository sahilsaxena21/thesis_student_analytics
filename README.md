# A Machine Learning Approach to Analyzing the Role of Academic Workload on Mental Well-Being in First-Year Undergraduate Engineering Students

## Abstract 

This study looked into the relationship between student Subjective Well-Being (SWB) and three self-reported academic workload measures, namely objective workload (i.e. the time spent outside of classroom to complete assigned work for a given course), transient objective workload (i.e. the extent of week-to-week variation in the total objective workload for all courses), and perceived workload difficulty (i.e. the extent of academic difficulty for a given course). Data was collected from a sample of first-year undergraduate engineering students at the University of Toronto (N = 851). At the aggregate level, all academic workload measures were found to be significantly higher in students reporting negative SWB compared to students reporting positive SWB. At the course level, findings from a machine learning binary classification model revealed that the objective workload of Engineering Strategies and Practice II course had the strongest negative influence towards the modelâ€™s SWB predictions. Areas for future research is discussed.
